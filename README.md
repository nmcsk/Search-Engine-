Done on Wikipedia dump(46GB)

I did this project on wikipedia dump(46GB) which is readily available on the internet.

1) Parsing done
2) Index formed : Seperate for seperate fields
3) Secondary index also formed (To fasciliate binary search)
3) Search code.

You can change the importance for a general query by changing priorities in the search code.
